# snake-game

## Background
This project creates a video game classic: Snake. Snake was originally a cellphone game launched on the Nokia in the late â€˜90s. In its simplest form, you control a snake that can go up, left, right, or down. The game board also contains one piece of snake food at a random location. When the snake eats this food, points are awarded, a new piece of food is generated in an a random unoccupied location, and the snake body grows. The goal is to eat as much snake food as you can. If the snake runs into the edge of the screen or a section of itself, the game is over.

## User Interface

The user interface is fairly simple. At the top left, there is a Button, "New Game" to start a new game. Clicking this button will start a new game, with a snake of size 2 in the center and started automatically (the snake starts moving upward on its own). The user will be able to control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys. A Label at the top right keeps track of the score. The score correlates to the size of the snake.

If the snake runs into the edge of the screen or into itself, the game will end and the user will be notified that the game is over.
